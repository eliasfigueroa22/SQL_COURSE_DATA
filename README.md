# Introduction
Welcome to my first project in my SQL portfolio, in this project I will be testing my SQL skills by filtering data that interests me about remote Data Analyst jobs abroad and the most in-demand and best-paid skills in the market, we will also briefly look at some data on jobs that interest me personally in countries of interest to me and see if this affects the type of skills that are in demand in the market for Data Analysts

Check out my SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)






# Background

The reason why I did this project was to practice my SQL skills and at the same time know which skills would be most useful to me to be a competitive Data Analyst, thus taking into account the most in-demand and best-paid skills in the market.

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse’s  [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?


# Tools I Used

### These were the tools I used to do this project

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.

- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

- **Git and Github:** To be able to share this project and have it stored for security and control


# The Analysis
Each query in this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Below is how I addressed each point:

### 1. Top-paying jobs for Data Analyst
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
-- What are the top-paying jobs for my role?

--Top 10 highest paying data analyst roles (remote)

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_country,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

These are the main points I discovered from these 10 highest-paying jobs in the field.
- **Salary range:** The annual salaries for these 10 positions range from $184,000 to $650,000, which means there is significant growth potential in the field.
- **Diverse companies:** Various types of companies in different sectors require data analysts, which means that there is a great need and interest in hiring Data Analysts in various sectors.
- **Variety of job titles:** It is also noted that there are different job titles for the positions offered, reflecting a wide variety of flexibility and specialization in the area.

 ### For this question I additionally made 2 queries, one of which shows me data analyst jobs specifically from countries of interest to me and then another query about data analyst jobs for my home country.

 ```sql
 --Remote jobs from countries of interest to me

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_country,
    job_location,
    job_work_from_home,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_country IN  ('Brazil','Argentina','Chile','Uruguay') AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home IS TRUE
ORDER BY
    job_country;



--Remote and local jobs in my country

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_country,
    job_location,
    job_work_from_home,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_country = 'Paraguay' AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst';


/*From "Remote and local jobs in my country" and "Remote jobs from countries of 
interest to me" theres no info from salary_year_avg, that is why I don't put 
a condition in WHERE to filter the salaryes/*
 ```

When making these queries, I realized that there is no salary information on the jobs published in the countries of my interest and in my country, so for this question, these queries are not useful to us. Later, we will approach the next questions in the same way.
 
 ### 2. Skills for Top-Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

 ```sql
/*Question: What skills are required for the top-paying data analyst jobs?*/

WITH top_paying_skills AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title, 
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_skills.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_skills
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_skills.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
 ```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023, based on the top 10 job postings:

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.

- **Query Construction**: Learning to build advanced SQL queries that combine multiple tables and employ functions like **`WITH`** clauses for temporary tables.

- **Data Aggregation**: Utilizing **`GROUP BY`** and aggregate functions like **`COUNT()`** and **`AVG()`** to summarize data effectively.

- **Analytical Thinking**: Developing the ability to translate real-world questions into actionable SQL queries that got insightful answers.

- **Workflow:** I learned how to upload data to a local server and got a sense of how work is done in the "real world" using tools like VSCode and Git to carry out processes step by step and in a controlled manner.

- **Creation of Projects on GitHub:** As it is my first project, I learned to have my repository on GitHub so I can share my projects with the community and know how each aspect of the page works.


# Conclusions
This project tested my skills (and patience, hehe) in creating SQL queries and my critical thinking when trying to obtain the information I needed. This allowed me to discover valuable information for the most optimal skills as a Data Analyst. This serves as a great learning path for people who want to pursue a career as a Data Analyst and use their time as efficiently as possible. It also made me really want to delve deeper into this world, encouraging me to continue learning more about useful tools for the market.
